**SUMMARY IS:** Summary:

Robert Gilpin, a 46-year-old male, was examined by Dr. Francisco H. Santiago on July 13, 2021, following an accident on January 14, 2021, involving an MTA bus. The incident caused Gilpin to suffer bruises, a left wrist fracture, and pain in various parts of his body. He received medical treatments at a facility along Utica Avenue, including chiropractic care, physical therapy, and acupuncture. Diagnostic tests revealed cervical and lumbar disc herniations and tenosynovitis of the biceps, among other injuries. Despite these conditions, Gilpin has seen an improvement and can carry on with daily activities and return to work, albeit with some physical restrictions. Dr. Santiago concluded the injuries were directly caused by the accident and Gilpin can benefit from continued therapy, but no more diagnostic tests or surgery is suggested in his field of specialty. Dr. Santiago attested under penalty of perjury that his assessment is true and accurate.
