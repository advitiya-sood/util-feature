- Instructions were provided in case the service is related to a Workers' Compensation case, car accident, or requires other insurance information.
- A stipulation is included to use Health Insurance as a secondary carrier if the case is associated with a No-Fault car accident and there is a deductible/co-payment due.
- The patient must notify the Medical Billing Agency within 30 days to dispute the debt's validity, failing which the debt will be considered valid.

**Court Decision:**

**Outcome:**

- If the information is not received or the debt is not disputed within the given time frame, the Medical Billing Agency may proceed with debt collection measures.

**Ultimate Resolution:**
