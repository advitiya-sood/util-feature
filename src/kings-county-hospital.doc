**SUMMARY IS:** Robert Gilpin, a 46-year-old male with a history of asthma and diabetes, was injured on January 14, 2021, after being struck by an MTA bus while riding a skateboard. He experienced left arm and neck pain, weakness in multiple nerve distributions, and was suspected of a brachial plexopathy or stretch injury. Initial CT scans ruled out cervical spine fracture but found multilevel degenerative changes. Gilpin was discharged the same day with instructions to follow up with orthopedics for his left arm weakness and a possible brachial plexopathy. On February 1, 2021, after continued pain and another fall, he presented again. X-rays revealed a non-displaced, intra-articular fracture of the distal radius in his left wrist. The injury required immobilization with a cast, and he was provided pain management. Gilpin was discharged with instructions to maintain non-weight bearing status for the left upper extremity, ice and elevate the extremity, and follow up orthopedic care as previously planned for February 9, 2021.
